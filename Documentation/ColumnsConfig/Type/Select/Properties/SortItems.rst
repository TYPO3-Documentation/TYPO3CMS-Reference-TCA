    The property :php:`sortItems` allows
    sorting of static select items by their values or labels.

    Built-in orderings are to sort items by their labels or values.
    It is also possible to define custom sorting via PHP code.

    When using grouped select fields with
    :ref:`itemGroups<columns-select-properties-item-groups>`, sorting happens
    on a per-group basis - all items within one group are sorted - as the
    group ordering is preserved.
