selectSingle
============

This page describes the :ref:`select <columns-select>` type with
renderType='selectSingle'.

The renderType selectSingle creates a drop-down box with items to select a single value. Only if
:ref:`size <columns-select-properties-size>` is set to a value greater than one, a box is rendered containing
all selectable elements from which one can be chosen.
