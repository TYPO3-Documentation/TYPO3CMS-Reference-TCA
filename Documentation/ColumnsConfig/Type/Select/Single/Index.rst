selectSingle
============

Single select fields display a select field from which only one value can be
chosen.

.. include:: /Includes/Images/Styleguide/RstIncludes/SelectSingle12.rst.txt

The renderType selectSingle creates a drop-down box with items to select a
single value. Only if :ref:`size <columns-select-properties-size>` is set to a
value greater than one, a box is rendered containing all selectable elements
from which one can be chosen.
