    If the select field uses the option `foreign_table <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tca:confval-select-byside-foreign-table>`_
    combined with `MM  <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tca:confval-select-byside-mm>`_,
    this setting influences the `Record object <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:database-record-objects>`_
    representing this database record to be used in Fluid templates.

    Fields of TCA type `select` without a `relationship` will always provide an
    array of static values.

    If this option is set to
    `oneToOne` or `manyToOne`, then a :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Domain\Record` object
    or :php:`NULL` is provided as value for the field. `maxitems  <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tca:confval-select-byside-maxitems>`_
    is automatically set to 1.

    In the other cases a collection
    (:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Collection\LazyRecordCollection`) of
    :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Domain\Record` objects is attached as value.

    All possible values are:

    `manyToOne`
        The current record may have a relationship to maximal one record.

    `oneToOne`
        Same as `manyToOne` but record it references may also just have maximal
        one relation to the current record type. This is currently not enforced.

    `manyToMany` (default):
        The current record can have a relationship to multiple records.

    `oneToMany`
        Same as `manyToMany` but record it references may just have maximal
        one relation to the current record type. This is currently not enforced.

    In the following example an select field only accepts one record. It
    is not necessary to set `maxitems  <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tca:confval-select-byside-maxitems>`_.

    ..  code-block:: php

        $GLOBALS['TCA'][$myTable]['columns']['myfield'] = [
            'config' => [
                'type' => 'select',
                'renderType' => 'selectMultipleSideBySide',
                'relationship' => 'manyToOne'
            ]
        ];

    The limiting behaviour of the TCA option `maxitems  <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tca:confval-select-byside-maxitems>`_
    is kept for backward compatibility. This means
    it is possible to have a :php:`oneToMany` relation with maximum one value
    allowed.
