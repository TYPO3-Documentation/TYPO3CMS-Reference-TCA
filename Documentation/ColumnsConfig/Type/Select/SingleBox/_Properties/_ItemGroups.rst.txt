    group, the value contains the label of the item group or its language

    items with no group defined are listed then the item groups in the order of
    their definition, each group with the corresponding items.

    Item groups are rendered as :html:`<optgroup>`.

    Item groups can also be defined for items in
    :confval:`foreign tables <select-singlebox-foreign-table>`.
