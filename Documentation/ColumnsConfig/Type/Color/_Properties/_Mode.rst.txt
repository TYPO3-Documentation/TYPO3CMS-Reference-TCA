    This property is related to the `placeholder` property. When defined, a
    checkbox will appear above the field. If that box is checked, the field can
    be used to enter whatever the user wants as usual. If the box is **not**
    checked, the field becomes read-only and the value saved to the database
    will be :code:`NULL`.

    ..  warning::
        In order for this property to apply properly, the DB column must be allowed
        to be :sql:`NULL`, and property :php:`nullable` must be set to :php:`true`.
