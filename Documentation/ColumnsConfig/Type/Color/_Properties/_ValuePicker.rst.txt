        It is now recommended to define associative array keys for the
        :php:`items` configuration of the TCA configuration :php:`valuePicker`.
        The recommended keys are: :php:`label` and :php:`value`. Existing
        numeric array configurations will be automatically migrated to the new
        associative format during TCA processing.

    items (array)
        An array with selectable items. Each item is an array with the first value being the label in the select
        drop-down (plain text label or `label reference <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:label-reference>`_) the second being the hex-value transferred to the input field.
        The value should have exactly 7 characters, as this is the maximum for a hex-value.
