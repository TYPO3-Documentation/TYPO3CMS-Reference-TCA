.. versionadded:: 11.4
   The TCA field type called `category` has been added to TYPO3 Core. Its main
   purpose is to simplify the TCA configuration when adding a category
   tree to a record. It therefore supersedes the :php:`CategoryRegistry` as well
   as the :php:`ExtensionManagementUtility->makeCategorizable()`, which has required
   creating a "TCA overrides" file.

..  versionadded:: 12.0
    When using the `category` type, TYPO3 takes care of
    :ref:`generating the according database field <t3coreapi:auto-generated-db-structure>`.
    A developer does not need to define this field in an extension's
    :file:`ext_tables.sql` file.

While using the type :php:`category`, TYPO3 takes care of generating the
necessary TCA configuration.
Developers only have to define the TCA column and add :php:`category` as the
desired TCA type in the tables's TCA file (inside or outside of the Overrides folder).

The following options can be overridden via :ref:`page TSconfig, TCE form
<t3tsconfig:pageTsConfigTceFormConfig>`:

*  `size`
*  `maxitems`
*  `minitems`
*  `readOnly`
*  `treeConfig`

.. note::

   It is still possible to configure a category tree with `type=select`
   and `renderType=selectTree` when you want to override specific fields, but in most cases the
   simplified :php:`category` TCA type is sufficient.
