..  confval:: relationship
    :name: category-relationship
    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$field]['config']
    :type: string
    :Scope: Display  / Proc.
    :RenderType: all
    :Default: manyToMany

    All possible values are:

    `oneToOne`
        Stores the uid of the selected category. When using this
        relationship, `maxitems=1` will automatically be added to
        the column configuration. While one record can only have a
        relation to one category, each category can
        still have a relationship to more then one record.

    `oneToMany`
        Stores the uids of selected categories in a comma-separated list.

    `manyToMany` (default):
        Uses the intermediate table :sql:`sys_category_record_mm`
        and only stores the categories count on the local side. This is the use
        case, which was previously accomplished using
        :php:`ExtensionManagementUtility->makeCategorizable()`.

    In the following example a category tree is displayed, but only one
    category can be selected.

    ..  code-block:: php

        $GLOBALS['TCA'][$myTable]['columns']['mainCategory'] = [
            'config' => [
                'type' => 'category',
                'relationship' => 'oneToOne'
            ]
        ];

    All other relevant options, for example `maxitems=1`, are being set
    automatically.
