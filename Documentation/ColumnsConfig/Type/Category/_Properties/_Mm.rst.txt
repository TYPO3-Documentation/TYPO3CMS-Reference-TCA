        TCA table column fields that define :php:`['config']['MM']` can omit the
        specification of the intermediate MM table layout in
        :ref:`ext_tables.sql <t3coreapi:ext_tables-sql>`. The TYPO3 database
        analyzer takes care of proper schema definition.

        Extensions are strongly encouraged to drop :sql:`CREATE TABLE` definitions
        from the :file:`ext_tables.sql` file for those intermediate tables
        referenced by TCA table columns. Dropping these definitions allows the Core
        to adapt and migrate definitions if needed.

    This value contains the name of the table in which to store a MM relation.
    It is used together with
    :ref:`foreign_table <columns-category-properties-foreign-table>`.

    The database field with a MM property only stores the number of records
    in the relation.

    Please have a look into the additional information
    in the :ref:`MM common property description <tca_property_MM>`
    and the :ref:`property MM of select field <columns-select-properties-mm>`
