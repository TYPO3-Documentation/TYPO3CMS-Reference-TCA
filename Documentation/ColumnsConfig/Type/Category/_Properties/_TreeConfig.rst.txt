    :name: category-treeConfig

    :type: array
    :Scope: Display
    :RenderType: :ref:`selectTree <columns-select-rendertype-selectTree>`

    Either `childrenField` or `parentField` has to be set - `childrenField` takes precedence. Keywords:

    dataProvider
        Allows to define a custom data provider class for usecases where special data preparation
        is necessary. By default ``\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Tree\TableConfiguration\DatabaseTreeDataProvider`` is used.

    childrenField (string)
        Field name of the foreign\_table that references the uid of the child records.

    parentField (string)
        Field name of the foreign\_table that references the uid of the parent record

    startingPoints (string, comma separated values)
        allows to set multiple records as roots for tree records.

        The setting takes a CSV value, e.g. `2,3,4711`, which takes records of the uids
        `2`, `3` and `4711` into account and creates a tree of these records.

        Additionally, each value used in `startingPoints` may be fed from a
        :ref:`site configuration <t3coreapi:sitehandling>`
        by using the `###SITE:###` syntax.

        Example:

        ..  code-block:: yaml

            # Site config
            base: /
            rootPageId: 1
            categories:
                root: 123


        ..  code-block:: php

            // Example TCA config
            'config' => [
                'treeConfig' => [
                    'startingPoints' => '1,2,###SITE:categories.root###',
                ],
            ],

        This will evaluate to :php:`'startingPoints' => '1,2,123'`.

    appearance (array, optional)
        showHeader (boolean)
            Whether to show the header of the tree that contains a field to filter the records and allows to expand or
            collapse all nodes

        expandAll (boolean)
            Whether to show the tree with all nodes expanded

        maxLevels (integer)
            The maximal amount of levels to be rendered (can be used to stop possible recursions)

        nonSelectableLevels (list, default "0")
            Comma-separated list of levels that will not be selectable, by default the root
            node (which is "0") cannot be selected
