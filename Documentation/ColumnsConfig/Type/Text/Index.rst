    When using the `text` type, TYPO3 takes care of
    :ref:`generating the according database field <t3coreapi:auto-generated-db-structure>`.
    A developer does not need to define this field in an extension's
    :file:`ext_tables.sql` file.

The :ref:`according database fields <t3coreapi:auto-generated-db-structure>`
for all render types are generated automatically.

Introduction
============

The `text` type is for multi-line text input, in the database
:file:`ext_tables.sql` files it is typically set to a :sql:`TEXT` column type.
In the backend, it is rendered in various shapes: It can be rendered as a simple
:html:`<textarea>`, as a :ref:`rich text editor (RTE) <t3coreapi:rte>`, as a
code block with syntax highlighting, and others.

The following :php:`renderTypes` are available:

*   :ref:`default <columns-text-renderType-default>`: A simple text area
    or a rich text field is rendered, if no renderType is specified.
*   :ref:`belayoutwizard <columns-text-renderType-belayoutwizard>`: The backend
    layout wizard is displayed in order to edit records of table
    :sql:`backend_layout` in the backend.
*   :ref:`codeEditor <columns-text-renderType-codeEditor>`: This render type
    triggers a code highlighter.

    ..  versionchanged:: 13.0
        In previous TYPO3 versions, the code editor was available via the system
        extension "t3editor". The functionality was moved into the system
        extension "backend". The render type :php:`t3editor` was renamed to
        :php:`codeEditor`. A TCA migration from the old value to the new one is
        in place.

*   :ref:`textTable <columns-text-renderType-textTable>`: The
    :php:`renderType = 'textTable'` triggers a view to manage frontend table
    display in the backend. It is used for the "table" :sql:`tt_content` content
    element.
