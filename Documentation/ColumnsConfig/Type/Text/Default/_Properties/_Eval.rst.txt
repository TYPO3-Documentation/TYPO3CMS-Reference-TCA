    Configuration of field evaluation. None of these apply for RTE fields.

    Some of these evaluation keywords will trigger a JavaScript pre-evaluation in the form. Other evaluations
    will be performed in the backend.

    The evaluation functions will be executed in the list-order, available keywords:

    trim
        The value in the field will have white spaces around it trimmed away.

:php:`deevaluateFieldValue()` called when opening the record and :php:`evaluateFieldValue()`
called for validation when saving the record:
