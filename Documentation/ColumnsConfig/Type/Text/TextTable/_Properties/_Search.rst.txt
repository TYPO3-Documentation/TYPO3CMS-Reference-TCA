..  confval:: search
    :name: text-table-search
    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$field]['config']['search']
    :type: array
    :Scope: Search
    :Types: :ref:`input <columns-input>`

    Defines additional search-related options for a given field.

    ..  confval:: pidonly
        :name: text-table-search-pidonly
        :type: boolean
        :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$field]['config']['search']['pidonly']

        Searches in the column only if search happens on the single page, does
        not search the field if searching in the whole table.

    ..  confval:: case
        :name: text-table-search-case
        :type: boolean
        :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$field]['config']['search']['case']

        Makes the search case-sensitive. This requires a proper database
        collation for the field, see your database documentation.

    ..  confval:: andWhere
        :name: text-table-search-andWhere
        :type: string
        :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$field]['config']['search']['andWhere']

        Additional SQL WHERE statement without 'AND'. With this it is possible
        to place an additional condition on the field when it is searched

        ..  literalinclude:: _Snippets/_Search.php
            :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/someTable.php

        This means that the "my_editor" field of the "tx_mytable" table will
        be searched in only for elements of type X and Y. This helps making any
        search more relevant.

        The above example uses the special field quoting syntax :php:`{#...}`
        around identifiers to be as :ref:`DBAL <t3coreapi:database>` compatible as
        possible.
