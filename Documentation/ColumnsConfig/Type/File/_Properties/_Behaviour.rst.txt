        Allows an editor to select in a localized record whether the value is copied
        over from default or source language record, or if the field has an own value
        in the localization. If set to true and if the table supports localization
        and if a localized record is edited, this setting enables FieldWizard
        :ref:`LocalizationStateSelector <columns-input-properties-fieldWizard-localizationStateSelector>`:
        Two or three radio buttons shown below the field input. The state of this is
        stored in a json encoded array in the database table called :code:`l10n_state`.
        It tells the DataHandler which fields of the localization records should be kept
        in sync if the underlying default or source record changes.

        This property can also be overridden by page TSconfig.

        :type: boolean
        :Scope: Proc.

        Default false. Disables that child records get moved along with their parent records. Usually if in a parent-child
        relation a parent record is moved to a different page (eg. via cut+paste from clipboard), the children are relocated
        along with the parent. This flag disables the child move.

        This property can also be overridden by page TSconfig.

        :type: boolean
        :Scope: Proc.
        :Default: true

        Usually when the parent record is deleted all attached
        :sql:`sys_file_references` are deleted. This default behaviour can be
        disabled here.

        This property can also be overridden by page TSconfig.
