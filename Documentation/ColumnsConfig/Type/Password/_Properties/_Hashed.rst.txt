    If :php:`hashed` is set to :php:`false`, if the field value will be saved as
    plaintext to the database.

    ..  note::

        The configuration :php:`'hashed' => false` has no effect for all fields in
        the tables :php:`be_users` and :php:`fe_users`. In general it is not
        recommended to save passwords as plain text to the database.
