    The control
    renders a button next to the password field allowing the user to generate
    a random password based on defined rules.

    Using the control adds the generated password to the corresponding field.
    The password is visible to the backend user only once and stored encrypted
    in the database. Integrators are also able to define whether the user
    is allowed to edit the generated password before saving.
