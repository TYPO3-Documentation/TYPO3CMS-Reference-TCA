        :type: userFunction
        :Scope: Display

        Provides a string that is displayed in front of the input field.
        The URL of the site is set by default if nothing has been defined.

        Assign a user function. It receives two arguments:

        *  The first argument is the parameters array containing the site object,
           the language id, the current table and the current row.
        *  The second argument is the reference object :php:`TcaSlug`.

        The user function should return the string which is then used for display
        purposes.

..  rubric:: Example: Set a slug field prefix

..  include:: /Images/Rst/Slug1.rst.txt

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Slug1.rst.txt

The user function can be implemented like this:
