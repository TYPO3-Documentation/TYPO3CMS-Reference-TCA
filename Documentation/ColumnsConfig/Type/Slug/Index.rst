    When using the `slug` type, TYPO3 takes care of
    :ref:`generating the according database field <t3coreapi:auto-generated-db-structure>`.
    A developer does not need to define this field in an extension's
    :file:`ext_tables.sql` file.

The main purpose of this type is to define parts of a URL path to generate and
resolve URLs.
