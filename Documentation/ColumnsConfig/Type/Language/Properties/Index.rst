=========================
Language field properties
=========================

Since the TCA type `language` is mostly based on the `type=select` internally, most
of the associated TCA and TSconfig options can still be applied. This includes
for example the `selectIcons` field wizard, as well as the :typoscript:`keepItems`
and :typoscript:`removeItems` page TSconfig options.

.. todo: add a list of properties here.
