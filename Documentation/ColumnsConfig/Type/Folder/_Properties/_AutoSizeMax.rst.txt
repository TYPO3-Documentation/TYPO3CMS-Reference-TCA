    The maximum size (height) of the select field.

    The size of the select field will be automatically adjusted based on
    the number of selected items. The select field will never be smaller than
    the specified :confval:`size <folder-size>` and never larger than
    the value of `autoSizeMax`.

    ..  note::
        Only has an effect if :confval:`maxitems <folder-maxitems>` is greater than 1.
