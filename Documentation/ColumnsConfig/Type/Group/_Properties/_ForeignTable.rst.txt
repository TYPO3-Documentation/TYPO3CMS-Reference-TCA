            Starting with TYPO3 13.4.10, this option is no longer needed.
            For extbase, the proper type is inferred from the first entry
            in the `allowed  <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tca:confval-group-allowed>`_
            TCA configuration option. You should only set this option if you
            need backward compatibility to previous TYPO3 versions.

    This property does not really exist for group-type fields. It was needed as
    a workaround for an Extbase limitation. It was used to resolve dependencies
    during Extbase persistence. It should hold the same values as property
    :ref:`allowed <columns-group-properties-allowed>`. Notice that only one
    table name is allowed here in contrast to the property
    :ref:`allowed <columns-group-properties-allowed>` itself.
