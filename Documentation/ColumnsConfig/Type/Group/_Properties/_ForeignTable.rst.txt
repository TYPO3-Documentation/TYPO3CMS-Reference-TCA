    This property does not really exist for group-type fields. It is needed as
    a workaround for an Extbase limitation. It is used to resolve dependencies
    during Extbase persistence. It should hold the same values as property
    :ref:`allowed <columns-group-properties-allowed>`. Notice that only one
    table name is allowed here in contrast to the property
    :ref:`allowed <columns-group-properties-allowed>` itself.
