    The "suggest wizard" is added by default to all database relation group fields. After a couple of characters have
    been typed into this field, an ajax based search starts and shows a list of records matching the search word.

    The syntax for the search is: `"multiple words" something`, so you can enclose words you want to find next to each other in double quotes.

    A :ref:`set of options <columns-group-properties-suggestOptions>` is available to configure search details.

    Setting this property to `true` disables the suggest wizard.
