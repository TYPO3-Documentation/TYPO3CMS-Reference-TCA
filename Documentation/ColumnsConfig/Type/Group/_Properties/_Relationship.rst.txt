    This setting influences the `Record object <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:database-record-objects>`_
    representing this database record to be used in Fluid templates.

    If this option is set to
    `oneToOne` or `manyToOne`, then a :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Domain\Record` object
    or :php:`NULL` is provided as value for the field. `maxitems  <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tca:confval-group-maxitems>`_
    is automatically set to 1.

    In the other cases a collection
    (:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Collection\LazyRecordCollection`) of
    :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Domain\Record` objects is attached as value.

    All possible values are:

    `manyToOne`
        The current record may have a relationship to maximal one record.

    `oneToOne`
        Same as `manyToOne` but record it references may also just have maximal
        one relation to the current record type. This is currently not enforced.

    `manyToMany` (default):
        The current record can have a relationship to multiple records.
        If `MM  <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tca:confval-group-mm>`_
        is set the relation will be stored in an intermediate MM - many to many
        table. Otherwise it will be stored as comma separated list of integers.

    `oneToMany`
        Same as `manyToMany` but record it references may just have maximal
        one relation to the current record type. This is currently not enforced.

    In the following example a group field is displayed as oneToOne:

    ..  code-block:: php

        $GLOBALS['TCA'][$myTable]['columns']['myfield'] = [
            'config' => [
                'type' => 'group',
                'relationship' => 'oneToOne'
            ]
        ];

    The behaviour of the TCA option :ref:`maxitems <columns-group-properties-maxitems>`
    is kept for backward compatibility. This means
    it is possible to have a :php:`oneToMany` relation with maximum one value
    allowed.
