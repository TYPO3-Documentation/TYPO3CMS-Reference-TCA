   :type: string (list of)
   :Scope: Proc. / Display
   :InternalType: all

   **Only with internal\_type='file'**

   Default value is '\*' which means that anything file-extension which is not allowed is denied.

   If you set this value (to for example "php,inc") AND the "allowed" key is an empty string all extensions
   are permitted *except* ".php" and ".inc" files (works like the :code:`[BE][fileExtensions]` configuration option).

   In other words:

   -  If you want to permit *only certain* file-extensions, use 'allowed' and not disallowed.

   -  If you want to permit *all file-extensions* except a few, set 'allowed' to blank ("") and enter the
      list of denied extensions in 'disallowed'.

   -  If you wish to *allow all extensions* with no exceptions, set 'allowed' to '\*' and disallowed to ''
