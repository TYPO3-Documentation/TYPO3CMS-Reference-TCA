   :type: string   :Scope: Display / Proc.
    **Required!**

    Configures the internal type of the "group" type of element.
    There are two possible options to choose from:

    folder
      This will create a field where folders can be attached to the record.

    db
      This will create a field where database records can be attached as references.

    The default value is none of them - you must specify one of the values correctly!
