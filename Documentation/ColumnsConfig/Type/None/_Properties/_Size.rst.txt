    Value for the width of the :code:`<input>` field. To set the input field to the full width of
    the form area, use the value 50. Default is 30.


..  versionchanged:: 12.0
    The TCA type `none` had two option keys for the same functionality: `cols` and
    `size`. In order to simplify the available configuration, `cols` has been
    dropped in favour of `size`.

..  rubric:: Migration

Rename the option `cols` to `size`.
