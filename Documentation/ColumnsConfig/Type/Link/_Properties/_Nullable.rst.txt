    This option was introduced to replace the TCA :php:`eval` option with
    :php:`null` as value.

    :Scope: Proc

    If set to true, a checkbox will appear, which by default deactivates the
    field. In the deactivated state the field is saved as :sql:`NULL` in the
    database. By activating the checkbox it is possible to set a value.
    If nothing is entered into the field, then an empty string will be saved and not a :sql:`NULL`.

    The database field must allow the :sql:`NULL` value.
