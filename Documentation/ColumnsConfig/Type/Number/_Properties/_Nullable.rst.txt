    If set to true, a checkbox will appear, which by default deactivates the
    field. In the deactivated state the field is saved as :sql:`NULL` in the
    database. By activating the checkbox it is possible to set a value.
    If nothing is entered into the field, then an empty string will be saved
    and not a :sql:`NULL`.

    The if database field is created automatically, it allow the :sql:`NULL`
    value.
