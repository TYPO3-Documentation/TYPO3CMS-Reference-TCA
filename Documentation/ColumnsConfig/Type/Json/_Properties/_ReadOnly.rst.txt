    :Scope: Display

    Renders the field in a way that the user can see the values but cannot edit
    them. The rendering is as similar as possible to the normal rendering but
    may differ in layout and size.

    ..  warning::
        This property affects only the display. It is still possible to write to those fields when using
        the :ref:`DataHandler <t3coreapi:tce>`.

    .. todo: add link after added to TSconfig reference

    This value can be overridden by page TSconfig.
