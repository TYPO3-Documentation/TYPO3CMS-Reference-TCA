    The number of rows in the JSON editor. May be corrected for harmonization
    between browsers. Will also automatically be increased if the content in
    the field is found to be of a certain length, thus the
    field will automatically fit the content. Default is 5. Max value is 20.

    This value can be overridden by page TSconfig.
