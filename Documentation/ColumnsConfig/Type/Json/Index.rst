    The TCA field type `json` has been added to TYPO3 Core.

    When using the `json` type, TYPO3 takes care of
    :ref:`generating the according database field <t3coreapi:auto-generated-db-structure>`.
    A developer does not need to define this field in an extension's
    :file:`ext_tables.sql` file.


..  note::
    Currently, we have not documented this TCA type in detail. In the meantime,
    you can find more information in the according
    :ref:`changelog <ext_core:feature-100088-1677965005>`. If you can
    help us with setting up the documentation for this type, please provide
    :ref:`a pull request <h2document:docs-contribute-git-docker>`.
