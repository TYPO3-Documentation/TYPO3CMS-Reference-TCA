    :name: input-eval
    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$field]['config']
    :type: string (list of keywords)
    :Scope: Display  / Proc.

    Configuration of field evaluation. See also :ref:`columns-input-eval`.

    Some of these evaluation keywords will trigger a JavaScript pre- evaluation in the form. Other evaluations will be
    performed in the backend. The evaluation functions will be executed in the list-order. Keywords:

    alpha
        Allows only a-zA-Z characters.

    alphanum
        Same as "alpha" but allows also "0-9"

    alphanum_x
        Same as "alphanum" but allows also "\_" and "-" chars.

    domainname
        Allows a domain name such as :samp:`example.org` and automatically transforms
        the value to `punicode <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode>`_ if needed.

    is\_in
        Will filter out any character in the input string which is  *not* found in the string entered in the
        property :ref:`is\_in <columns-input-properties-is-in>`.

    lower
        Converts the string to lowercase (only A-Z plus a selected set of Western European special chars).

    md5
        Will convert the input value to its md5-hash using a JavaScript function.

    nospace
        Removes all occurrences of space characters (:php:`chr(32)`)

    num
        Allows only 0-9 characters in the field.

    trim
        The value in the field will have white spaces around it trimmed away.

    unique
        Requires the field to be unique for the *whole* table. Evaluated on the server only.

        ..  note::
            When selecting on unique-fields, make sure to select using :code:`AND pid>=0` since the field *can* contain
            duplicate values in other versions of records (always having PID = -1). This also means that if you are using
            versioning on a table where the unique-feature is used you cannot set the field to be truly unique
            in the database either!

    uniqueInPid
        Requires the field to be unique for the current PID among other records on the same page.
        Evaluated on the server only.

    upper
        Converts to uppercase (only A-Z plus a selected set of Western European special chars).

    year
        ..  versionchanged:: 14.0
            The previous implementation simply cast the year to an integer.
            Consider using more appropriate field types like 'number' or
            'datetime' for better data handling and validation.

        Evaluates the input to any number.
        This is actually a historically wrongly named evaluation that suggested
        only values between 1970 and 2038 would be allowed, which was never
        enforced properly though, and only applied in certain column definitions
        (signed integer, stripping negative values). Instead, better use the
        `TCA type='number'`, and set TCA restrictions for `range.lower=1970`
        and `range.upper=2038` (or any other number) values, see
        :ref:`range <t3tca:confval-number-range>`. This type will then already
        ensure only numbers can be picked.
