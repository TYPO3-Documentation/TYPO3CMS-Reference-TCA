    :type: integer
    :Scope: Display

    This option allows to define a minimum number of characters for the
    :html:`<input>` field and adds a :html:`minlength` attribute to the field.
    If at least one character is typed in and the number of characters is less
    than :php:`min`, the FormEngine marks the field as invalid, preventing the
    user to save the element. DataHandler will also take care for server-side
    validation and reset the value to an empty string, if :php:`min` is not
    reached.

    When using :php:`min` in combination with :ref:`columns-input-properties-max`,
    one has to make sure, the :php:`min` value is less than or equal :php:`max`.
    Otherwise the option is ignored.

    Empty fields are not validated. If one needs to have non-empty values, it is
    recommended to use :php:`required => true` in combination with :php:`min`.
