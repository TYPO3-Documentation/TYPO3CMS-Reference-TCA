    If the evaluation type "is\_in" (see :ref:`eval <columns-input-properties-eval>`) is used for evaluation, then
    the characters in the input string should be found in this string as well. This value is also passed
    as argument to the evaluation function if a user-defined evaluation function is registered.

    ..  note::
        The "is\_in" value is trimmed during processing, leading and trailing whitespaces are removed. If
        whitespaces should be allowed, it should be in between other characters, example :php:`a b`.
