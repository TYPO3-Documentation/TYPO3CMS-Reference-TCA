    :type: integer
    :Scope: Display

    Value for the "maxlength" attribute of the :code:`<input>` field. Javascript prevents adding more than
    these number of characters.

    If the form element edits a varchar(40) field in the database you should also set this value to 40.

    ..  note::
        If you reduce this value and there is already content longer then :confval:`input-max` the input will be cropped without notice on saving.
