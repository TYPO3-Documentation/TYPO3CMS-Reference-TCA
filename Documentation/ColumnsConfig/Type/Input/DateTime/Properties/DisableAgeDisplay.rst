disableAgeDisplay
=================

   :type: boolean   :Scope: Display
    Disable the display of the age (p.e. "2015-08-30 (-27 days)") of date fields in some places of the backend,
    for instance the list module. It will be respected if the field has the type `input` and its eval is set to `date`.
