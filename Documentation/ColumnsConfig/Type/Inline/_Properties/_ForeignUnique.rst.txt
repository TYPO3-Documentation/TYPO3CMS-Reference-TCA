     Field which must be unique for all children of a parent record.

..  rubric:: Example

Say you have two tables, products, your parent table, and prices, your child table (products) can have
multiple prices. The prices table has a field called customer\_group, which is a selector box. Now you want to be
able to specify prices for each customer group when you edit a product, but of course you don't want to specify
contradicting prices for one product (i.e. two different prices for the same customer\_group). That's why you
would set :code:`foreign_unique` to the field name "customer\_group", to prevent that two prices for the
same customer group can be created for one product.
