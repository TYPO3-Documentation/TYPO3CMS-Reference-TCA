..  confval:: foreign_sortby
    :name: inline-foreign-sortby
    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$field]['config']
    :type: string
    :Scope: Display / Proc.

    Define a field on the child record that stores the manual sorting
    information. It is possible to have a different sorting, depending from
    which side of the relation we look at parent or child.

    ..  attention::
        Do not confuse this property with :ref:`foreign_default_sortby <columns-inline-properties-foreign-default-sortby>`.
        The `foreign_sortby` field contains an integer and is managed by the DataHandler. If by accident a content column
        like "title" is set as `foreign_sortby`, the DataHandler will write these integers into that field, which is most
        likely *not* what you want. Use `foreign_default_sortby` in this case.

    This property requires that the
    :ref:`foreign_field <columns-inline-properties-foreign-field>` approach is
    used.

    When using :ref:`MM relations<columns-inline-properties-mm>` the field used
    on the intermediate table is hardcoded to :sql:`sorting_foreign`. Setting
    this property has no effect combined with an MM table.

    ..  warning::
        If you use the table only as an inline element, do not put the :ref:`sortby <ctrl-reference-sortby>` field
        in the :ref:`ctrl <ctrl>` section, otherwise TYPO3 CMS will sort the entire table with every update.
        For example, if you have 10000 records, each with 4 inline elements, TYPO3 CMS will sort 40000 records even
        if only 4 must be sorted.
