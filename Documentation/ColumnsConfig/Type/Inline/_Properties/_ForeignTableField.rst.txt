    The :code:`foreign_table_field` is the field of the child record pointing to the parent record. This defines where
    to store the table name of the parent record. On setting this configuration key together with
    :ref:`foreign_field <columns-inline-properties-foreign-field>`, the child record knows what its parent record is â€“
    so the child record could also be used on other parent tables. This issue is also known as "weak entity". Do not
    confuse with :ref:`foreign_table <columns-inline-properties-foreign-table>` or
    :ref:`foreign_field <columns-inline-properties-foreign-field>`. It has its own behavior.
