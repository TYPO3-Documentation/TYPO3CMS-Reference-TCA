        :default: false

        Allows an editor to select in a localized record whether the value is copied
        over from default or source language record, or if the field has an own value
        in the localization. If set to true and if the table supports localization
        and if a localized record is edited, this setting enables FieldWizard
        :ref:`LocalizationStateSelector <columns-input-properties-fieldWizard-localizationStateSelector>`:
        Two or three radio buttons shown below the field input. The state of this is
        stored in a json encoded array in the database table called :code:`l10n_state`.
        It tells the DataHandler which fields of the localization records should be kept
        in sync if the underlying default or source record changes.

        :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$field]['config']['behaviour']
        :type: boolean
        :Scope: Proc.

        Default false. Disables that child records get moved along with their parent records. Usually if in a parent-child
        relation a parent record is moved to a different page (eg. via cut+paste from clipboard), the children are relocated
        along with the parent. This flag disables the child move.

        This property can be especially useful if all child records should be gathered in one storage folder and their
        parents are spread out at different places in the page tree. In combination with the
        :ref:`Tsconfig setting <t3tsconfig:usertoplevelobjects>` :typoscript:`TCAdefaults.<table>.pid = <page id>` children
        can be forced to be created in this folder and stay there.

        :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$field]['config']['behaviour']
        :type: boolean
        :Scope: Proc.

        Default true. Usually in inline relations, if a parent is deleted, all children are deleted along with the parent.
        This flag can be used to disable that cascading delete. Example usage: A frontend user (parent) has assigned
        invoices (children). If a frontend user is deleted, it could be useful to keep the invoices.
