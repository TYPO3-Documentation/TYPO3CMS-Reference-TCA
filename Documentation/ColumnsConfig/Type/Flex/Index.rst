==============
FlexForm field
==============

..  versionadded:: 13.0
    When using the `flex` type, TYPO3 takes care of
    :ref:`generating the according database field <t3coreapi:auto-generated-db-structure>`.
    A developer does not need to define this field in an extension's
    :file:`ext_tables.sql` file.

Renders a :ref:`FlexForm <t3coreapi:flexforms>` element. Essentially, this consists in a
hierarchically organized set of fields which will have their values saved into a
single field in the database, stored as XML.

The :ref:`according database field <t3coreapi:auto-generated-db-structure>`
is generated automatically.

The general idea is: There is a data structure that defines which and how single
fields should be displayed, re-using all the TCA column type possibilities. The
actual values of single fields are then stored in an XML representation within
this "flex" field.

Properties of the TCA column type `flex`
========================================

..  versionchanged:: 13.0
    The configuration options `ds_tableField`, `ds_pointerField_searchParent_subField`
    and `ds_pointerField_searchParent` are not handled anymore. Use the
    :ref:`Events <columns-flex-events>` to replace their logic if needed.

..  _columns-flex-special-ds:

Defining multiple data structures for different records
=======================================================

There can be multiple data structures defined in `TCA` and it depends on the
configuration and the record which one is chosen. If the :confval:`flex-ds`
and :confval:`flex-ds-pointerField` are not sufficient, you can use the
:ref:`Events <columns-flex-events>` to manipulate with data structure should be
displayed.

..  note::
    It is **not** possible to override these properties in
    :ref:`TCA type columnsOverrides <types-properties-columnsOverrides>` or to manipulate
    them in an inline parent-child relation from the parent `TCA`.

..  _columns-flex-events:

Events to manipulate the FlexForm data structure
================================================

There are appropriate events that allow the manipulation of the data structure
lookup logic:

*   :ref:`t3coreapi:AfterFlexFormDataStructureIdentifierInitializedEvent`
*   :ref:`t3coreapi:AfterFlexFormDataStructureParsedEvent`
*   :ref:`t3coreapi:BeforeFlexFormDataStructureIdentifierInitializedEvent`
*   :ref:`t3coreapi:BeforeFlexFormDataStructureParsedEvent`
