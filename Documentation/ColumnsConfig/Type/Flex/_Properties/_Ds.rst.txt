    :type: array
    :Scope: Display  / Proc.

    Data Structure(s) defined in an array.

    Each key is a value that can be pointed to by :ref:`ds_pointerField <columns-flex-properties-ds-pointerfield>`.
    Default key is "default" which is what you should use if you do not have a :code:`ds_pointerField` value of course.

    If you specified more than one :code:`ds_pointerField`, the keys in this "ds" array should contain comma-separated
    value pairs where the asterisk \* matches all values (see the example below). If you don't need to switch for the
    second :code:`ds_pointerField`, it's also possible to use only the first :code:`ds_pointerField`'s value as a key in
    the "ds" array without necessarily suffixing it with ",\*" for a catch-all on the second :code:`ds_pointerField`.

    For each value in the array there are two options:

    *   Make a reference to an external XML file
    *   Either enter XML directly

..  rubric:: Example with XML in external file

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/FlexFile1.rst.txt

The included file:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/FlexFormFile1.rst.txt

..  rubric:: Example with XML directly entered

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/Flex2.rst.txt
