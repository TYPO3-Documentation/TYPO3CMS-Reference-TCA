    Configuration of field evaluation.

    Some of these evaluation keywords will trigger a JavaScript pre- evaluation in the form. Other evaluations will be
    performed in the backend. The evaluation functions will be executed in the list-order. Keywords:

    unique
        Requires the field to be unique for the *whole* table. Evaluated on the server only.

        ..  note::
            When selecting on unique-fields, make sure to select using :code:`AND pid>=0` since the field *can* contain
            duplicate values in other versions of records (always having PID = -1). This also means that if you are using
            versioning on a table where the unique-feature is used you cannot set the field to be truly unique
            in the database either!

    uniqueInPid
        Requires the field to be unique for the current PID among other records on the same page.
        Evaluated on the server only.
