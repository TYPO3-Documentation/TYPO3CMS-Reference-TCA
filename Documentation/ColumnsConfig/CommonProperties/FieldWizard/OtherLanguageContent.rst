   :type: array
   :Scope: fieldWizard
   :Types: :ref:`check <columns-check>`, :ref:`flex <columns-flex>`,
      :ref:`group <columns-group>`,
      :ref:`imageManipulation <columns-imageManipulation>`,
      :ref:`input <columns-input>`, :ref:`radio <columns-radio>`

   Show values from the default language record and other localized records if the edited row is a
   localized record. Often used in :php:`tt_content` fields. By default, only the value of the default
   language record is shown, values from further translations can be shown by setting the
   :ref:`user TSconfig property additionalPreviewLanguages <t3tsconfig:useroptions-additionalPreviewLanguages>`.

   The wizard shows content only for "simple" fields. For instance, it does not work for database relation fields,
   and if the field is set to :php:`readOnly`. Additionally, the table has to be language aware by setting up the
   according fields in ['ctrl'] section.
