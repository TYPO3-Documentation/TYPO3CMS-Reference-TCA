   :type: array
   :Scope: fieldWizard
   :Types: :ref:`check <columns-check>`, :ref:`flex <columns-flex>`,
      :ref:`group <columns-group>`,
      :ref:`imageManipulation <columns-imageManipulation>`,
      :ref:`input <columns-input>`, :ref:`radio <columns-radio>`

   Show a "diff-view" if the content of the default language record has been changed after the
   translation overlay has been created. The ['ctrl'] section property
   :ref:`transOrigDiffSourceField <ctrl-reference-transorigdiffsourcefield>` has to be specified
   to enable this wizard in a translated record.

   This wizard is important for editors who maintain translated records: They can see what has been
   changed in their localization parent between the last save operation of the overlay.
