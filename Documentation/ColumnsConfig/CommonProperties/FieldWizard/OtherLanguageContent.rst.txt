:aspect:`Description`
    Show values from the default language record and other localized records if the edited row is a
    localized record. Often used in :php:`tt_content` fields. By default, only the value of the default
    language record is shown, values from further translations can be shown by setting the
    :ref:`userTsConfig property additionalPreviewLanguages <t3tsconfig:useroptions-additionalPreviewLanguages>`.

    The wizard shows content only for "simple" fields. For instance, it does not work for database relation fields,
    and if the field is set to :php:`readOnly`. Additionally, the table has to be language aware by setting up the
    according fields in ['ctrl'] section.
