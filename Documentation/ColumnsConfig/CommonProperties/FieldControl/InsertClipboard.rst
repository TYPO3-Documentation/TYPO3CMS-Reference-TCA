:aspect:`Description`
    The clipboard control adds a control button for :code:`type='group'` to paste records from
    a users clipboard into the selection. It is enabled by default for :code:`type='group'` and
    shown below the :ref:`element browser <columns-group-properties-elementBrowser>` if the
    order has not been changed using the `before` and `after` keywords. It can be turned off by
    setting `disabled` to true, just like any other fieldControl.
