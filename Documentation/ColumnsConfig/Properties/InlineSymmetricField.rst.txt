:aspect:`Description`
    This works like :ref:`foreign_field <columns-inline-properties-foreign-field>`, but in case of using
    bidirectional symmetric relations. :code:`symmetric_field` defines in which field on
    the :ref:`foreign_table <columns-inline-properties-foreign-table>` the uid of the "other" parent is stored.
