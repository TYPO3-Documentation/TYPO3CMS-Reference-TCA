MM
~~

:aspect:`Datatype`
    string (table name)

:aspect:`Scope`
    Proc.

:aspect:`Description`
    Means that the relation to the records of :ref:`foreign_table <columns-select-properties-foreign-table>`
    (or table specified in :ref:`allowed <columns-group-properties-allowed>` property in case of the group field) is done
    with a M-M relation with a third "join" table.

    The intermediate table has three columns as a minimum:

    uid\_local, uid\_foreign (Required)
      Storing uids of both sides. If done right, this is reflected in the table name - :code:`tx_foo_local_foreign_mm`

    sorting (Required)
      Is a required field used for ordering the items.

    sorting\_foreign
      Is required if the relation is bidirectional (see description and example below table)

    tablenames
      Is used if multiple tables are allowed in the relation.

    uid (auto-incremented and PRIMARY KEY)
      May be used if you need the "multiple" feature (which allows the same record to be references multiple times
      in the box. See :ref:`MM_hasUidField <columns-select-properties-mm-hasuidfield>` for type='select' and
      :ref:`MM_hasUidField <columns-group-properties-mm-hasuidfield>` for type='group' fields.

    further fields
      May exist, in particular if :ref:`MM_match_fields <columns-select-properties-mm-match-fields>` /
      :ref:`MM_match_fields <columns-group-properties-mm-match-fields>` is involved in the set up.

    Example SQL #1
      Most simple MM table

      .. code-block:: php

          CREATE TABLE tx_testmmrelations_one_rel_mm (
              uid_local int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
              uid_foreign int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
              sorting int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,

              KEY uid_local (uid_local),
              KEY uid_foreign (uid_foreign)
          );

    Example SQL #2
      Advanced with uid field, "ident" used with :ref:`MM_match_fields <columns-select-properties-mm-match-fields>`
      and "sorting_foreign" for bidirectional MM relations:

      .. code-block:: php

        CREATE TABLE tx_testmmrelations_two_rel_mm (
            uid int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
            uid_local int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
            uid_foreign int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
            tablenames varchar(30) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL,
            sorting int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
            sorting_foreign int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
            ident varchar(30) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL,

            KEY uid_local (uid_local),
            KEY uid_foreign (uid_foreign),
            PRIMARY KEY (uid)
        );

    Value of field
      The field name of the config is not used for data-storage anymore but rather it's set to the number of records
      in the relation on each update, so the field should be an integer.

    MM relations and flexforms
      MM relations has been tested to work with flexforms if not in a repeated element in a section.

    .. note::
        Using MM relations you can ONLY store real relations for foreign tables in the list - no additional
        string values or non-record values.
