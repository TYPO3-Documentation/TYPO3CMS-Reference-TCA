    Configures the internal type of the "group" type of element.
    There are two possible options to choose from:

    folder
      This will create a field where folders can be attached to the record.

    db
      This will create a field where database records can be attached as references.

    The default value is none of them - you must specify one of the values correctly!

    .. deprecated:: 9.5
       The internal types `file` and `file_reference` have been deprecated with
       TYPO3 9 and removed with TYPO3 10. Extensions that used group fields
       with these internal types should switch to use
       :ref:`FAL references <tca_example_inline_fal_inline_1>` based on
       `type=inline` instead.
