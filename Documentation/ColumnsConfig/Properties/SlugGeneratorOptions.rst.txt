:aspect:`Description`
    Holds information about the record fields to be used for slug generation:

    fields (array)
      Insert several field names (of type string or array) that will be considered during slug construction.

      .. note::

        For the time being, only the `title` field of table pages is evaluated to construct the slug from.


    fieldSeparator (string)
      This value will divide the slug parts. If a section value contains this very value, it will be replaced by
      the value given in :ref:`fallbackCharacter <columns-slug-properties-fallbackCharacter>`.

    prefixParentPageSlug (boolean)
      The slugs of parent pages will be prefixed to the slug for the page itself. Disable it for shorter URLs, but
      take the higher chance of collision into consideration.

    replacements (array)
      It allows to replace strings of a slug part. Add one of more array items with the key being the string
      to replace and the value being the replacement string.

      Example::

         'config' => [
             'type' => 'slug',
             'generatorOptions' => [
                 'fields' => ['nav_title', 'title'],
                 'replacements' => [
                     '(f/m)' => '',
                     '/' => '-'
                 ],
             ],
             'fallbackCharacter' => '-',
             'prependSlash' => true,
             'eval' => 'uniqueInPid'
         ]

      This will change the provided slug **'Some Job in city1/city2 (f/m)'** to **'some-job-in-city1-city2'**.
