        evaluate if a record is unique in its table.

    uniqueInSite
        evaluate if a record is unique in a page tree (specific to a language). Be careful on a multi-domain setup
        when using one storage folder for different site roots.

    uniqueInPid
        Requires the field to be unique for the current PID among other records on the same page.

    No other eval setting is checked for. It is possible to set both eval options, however it is
    recommended not to do so.
