:aspect:`Description`
    In how many columns the checkboxes will be shown. Makes sense only if the 'items' property is defining multiple
    checkboxes.

    Allowed values are 1, 2, 3, ..., 31 or `inline`, 1 being default. If set to `inline` the checkboxes are
    "floating" and there will be as many in one row as fits to browser width.

    Note checkboxes will still wrap if browser width is not sufficient.
