:aspect:`Datatype`
    array

:aspect:`Scope`
    Display / Proc.

:aspect:`Description`
    Data Structure(s) defined in an array.

    Each key is a value that can be pointed to by :ref:`ds_pointerField <columns-flex-properties-ds-pointerfield>`.
    Default key is "default" which is what you should use if you do not have a :code:`ds_pointerField` value of course.

    If you specified more than one :code:`ds_pointerField`, the keys in this "ds" array should contain comma-separated
    value pairs where the asterisk \* matches all values (see the example below). If you don't need to switch for the
    second ds\_pointerField, it's also possible to use only the first :code:`ds_pointerField`'s value as a key in
    the "ds" array without necessarily suffixing it with ",\*" for a catch-all on the second :code:`ds_pointerField`.

    For each value in the array there are two options:

    - Either enter XML directly

    - Make a reference to an external XML file

    **Example with XML directly entered:**

    .. code-block:: php

        'config' => [
            'type' => 'flex',
            'ds_pointerField' => 'list_type',
            'ds' => [
                'default' => '
                    <T3DataStructure>
                      <ROOT>
                        <type>array</type>
                        <el>
                          <xmlTitle>
                            <TCEforms>
                              <label>The Title:</label>
                              <config>
                                <type>input</type>
                              </config>
                            </TCEforms>
                          </xmlTitle>
                        </el>
                      </ROOT>
                    </T3DataStructure>
                ',
            ],
        ],

    **Example with XML in external file:**

    .. code-block:: php

        'config' => [
            'type' => 'flex',
            'ds_pointerField' => 'list_type',
            'ds' => [
                'default' => 'FILE:EXT:mininews/Configuration/FlexForms/Mininews.xml',
            ],
        ],
