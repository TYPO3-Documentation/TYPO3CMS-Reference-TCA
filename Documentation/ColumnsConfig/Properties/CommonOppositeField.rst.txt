:aspect:`Description`
    If you want to make a MM relation editable from the foreign side (bidirectional) of the relation as well, you need
    to set `MM_opposite_field` on the foreign side to the field name on the local side.

    E.g. if the field "companies.employees" is your local side and you want to make the same relation editable from
    the foreign side of the relation in a field called persons.employers, you would need to set the `MM_opposite_field`
    value of the TCA configuration of the persons.employers field to the string "employees".

    .. note::
        Bidirectional references only get registered once on the native side in "sys\_refindex".
