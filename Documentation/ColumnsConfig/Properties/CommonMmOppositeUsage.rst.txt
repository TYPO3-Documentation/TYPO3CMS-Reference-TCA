:aspect:`Description`
    In a MM bidirectional relation using :ref:`select match fields <columns-select-properties-mm-match-fields>`
    / :ref:`group match fields <columns-group-properties-mm-match-fields>` the opposite side needs to know about
    the match fields for certain operations (for example, when a copy is created in a workspace) so that relations
    are carried over with the correct information.

    `MM_oppositeUsage` is an array which references whichfields contain the references to the opposite side, so that
    they can be queried for match field configuration.

    This is used by the Core for system categories. Whenever a table is registered as being categorizable, an entry
    in `MM_oppositeUsage` is created for the "sys_category" table.

    Example
      With "pages", "tt_content" and "sys_file_metadata" all registered as categorizable (using the default name
      of "categories" for the relations field) plus extension "examples" installed, the TCA for "sys_category"
      contains the following definition once fully assembled:

      .. code-block:: php

          $GLOBALS['TCA']['sys_category']['columns']['items']['config']['MM_oppositeUsage'] = [
              'pages' => ['tx_examples_cats', 'categories'],
              'sys_file_metadata' => ['categories'],
              'tt_content' => ['categories'],
          ];
