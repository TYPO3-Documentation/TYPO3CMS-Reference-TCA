foreign\_table\_where
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:aspect:`Datatype`
    string (SQL WHERE)

:aspect:`Scope`
    Proc. / Display

:aspect:`Description`
    The items from :ref:`foreign_table <columns-select-properties-foreign-table>` are selected with this WHERE-clause.

    The table is joined with the "pages"-table and items are selected only from pages where the user has read access!
    (Not checking DB mount limitations!)

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: none

        AND {#tx_my_foreign_table}.{#pid} = 0 ORDER BY tx_my_foreign_table.sorting

    **Field quoting**

    The above example uses the special field quoting syntax :php:`{#...}` around identifiers of the
    :ref:`QueryHelper <t3coreapi:database-query-helper-quoteDatabaseIdentifiers>` to be as DBAL compatible
    as possible. Note that the :php:`ORDER BY` is NOT quoted since that is parsed out anyway and
    always receives proper quoting.

    **Markers:**

    It is possible to use markers in the WHERE clause:

    - ###REC\_FIELD\_[*field name*]###
      Any field of the current record.

      .. note::
          The field name part of the marker is not in upper case letters.
          It must match the exact case used in the database.

    - ###THIS\_UID###
      Current element uid (zero if new).

    - ###CURRENT\_PID###
      The current page id (pid of the record).

    - ###SITEROOT###

    - ###PAGE\_TSCONFIG\_ID###
      A value you can set from Page TSconfig dynamically.

    - ###PAGE\_TSCONFIG\_IDLIST###
      A value you can set from Page TSconfig dynamically.

    - ###PAGE\_TSCONFIG\_STR###
      A value you can set from Page TSconfig dynamically.

    The markers are preprocessed so that the value of CURRENT\_PID and PAGE\_TSCONFIG\_ID are always integers
    (default is zero), PAGE\_TSCONFIG\_IDLIST will always be a comma-separated list of integers (default is zero)
    and PAGE\_TSCONFIG\_STR will be addslashes'ed before substitution (default is blank string).

    More information about markers set by Page TSconfig can be found in
    the :ref:`TSconfig reference <t3tsconfig:pagetceformconfobj>`.
