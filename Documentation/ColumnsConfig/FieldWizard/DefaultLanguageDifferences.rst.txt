:aspect:`Description`
    Show a "diff-view" if the content of the default language record has been changed after the
    translation overlay has been created. The ['ctrl'] section property
    :ref:`transOrigDiffSourceField <ctrl-reference-transorigdiffsourcefield>` has to be specified
    to enable this wizard in a translated record.

    This wizard is important for editors who maintain translated records: They can see what has been
    changed in their localization parent between the last save operation of the overlay.
