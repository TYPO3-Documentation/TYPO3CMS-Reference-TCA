------------------------

.. note::

   This page is for an outdated TYPO3 version (7.6). For newer versions, you
   can find the information in:

   *  TYPO3 Explained: :ref:`t3coreapi:extending-tca` (7.6)


Being a PHP array, the Table Configuration Array can be easily
extended. It can be accessed as the global variable :code:`$GLOBALS['TCA']`.
TYPO3 also provides APIs for making this simpler.
