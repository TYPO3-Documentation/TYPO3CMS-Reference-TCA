Required type examples
----------------------

..  _types-examples-required-minimal:

Required type - minimal configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The type :php:`0` is required to be defined. It has to have at least the
property :ref:`showitem <types-properties-showitem>` defined. A minimal
configuration can be seen here, for example:

..  include:: /CodeSnippets/TypeMinimal.rst.txt

It displays nothing but a single field.

..  _types-examples-required-tabs:

Required type - tabs and palettes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration specifies two tabs: the first one labelled "general"
with three fields "category" "subject" and "message", and the second one
labelled "access" with the field "personal". Only the default type "0" is
specified. Opening such a record looks like this:

..  include:: /Images/Rst/TxStyleguideCtrlCommon.rst.txt
