Example using bitmasks
======================

Demonstrates property: :confval:` types-bitmask_value_field` and
:confval:`types-bitmask_excludelist_bits`.

..  warning:: These properties will be removed in TYPO3 without replacement.

    In case, extensions still use this setting, they should switch to casual
    :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA']['someTable']['ctrl']['type']` fields instead, which
    can be powered by columns based on string values.

..  code-block:: php

    'types' => [
       'aType' => [
          'showitem' => 'aField, anotherField, yetAnotherField',
          'bitmask_value_field' => 'theSubtypeValueField',
          'bitmask_excludelist_bits' => [
             '-1' => 'anotherField', // Remove if bit 1 is NOT set
             '+2' => 'yetAnotherField', // Remove if bit 2 is set
          ],
       ],
    ],

With the above configuration, if field database "theSubtypeValueField" is set to value 5 (binary representation
"1 0 1"), the fields "anotherField" (-1 = 0 at bit position 1) and "yetAnotherField" (+2 = 1 at bit position 2)
are not displayed, thus leaving only field "aField". If the value is 1 (binary representation "0 0 1"), fields
"aField" and "yetAnotherField" are shown, while "anotherField" is not.
