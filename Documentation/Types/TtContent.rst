:navigation-title: tt_content system fields

..  _types-content:

=================================================================
Automatically added system fields to content types (`tt_content`)
=================================================================

..  versionchanged:: 13.3
    Creating content elements has been simplified by removing the need to
    define the system fields for each element again and again. This shrinks
    down a content element's :confval:`types-showitem` to just the element
    specific fields. See also :ref:`Migration <types-content-migration>`.
    Added with :ref:`changelog:feature-104814-1725444916`.

The following tabs / palettes are added automatically to the :confval:`types-showitem`
property of table `tt_content`:

*   The :guilabel:`General` tab with the `general` palette at the very beginning
*   The :guilabel:`Language` tab with the `language` palette after custom fields
*   The :guilabel:`Access` tab with the `hidden` and `access` palettes
*   The :guilabel:`Notes` tab with the `rowDescription` field

    The underlined tabs are added automatically.

See :ref:`types-content-examples-extended` for an example.

..  note::

    The fields are added to the :confval:`types-showitem` through their corresponding
    :ref:`palettes <palettes>`. In case such palette has been changed
    by extensions, the required system fields are added individually to corresponding tabs.

In case one of those palettes has been changed to no longer
include the corresponding system fields, those fields are added individually
depending on their definition in the :ref:`ctrl` section.

By default, all custom fields - the ones still defined in :confval:`types-showitem` - are
added after the `general` palette and are therefore added to the
:guilabel:`General` tab, unless a custom tab (for example :guilabel:`Plugin`,
or :guilabel:`Categories`) is defined in between. It's also possible to start
with a custom tab by defining a `--div--` as the first item in the
:confval:`types-showitem`. In this case, the :guilabel:`General` tab will be omitted.

All those system fields, which are added based on the :php:`ctrl` section are
also automatically removed from any custom palette and from the customized
type's :confval:`types-showitem` definition.

If the content element defines the :guilabel:`Extended` tab, it will be
inserted at the end, including all fields added to the type via API methods,
without specifying a position, via
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addToAllTcaTypes()`. See
:ref:`types-content-examples-extended` for an example.

Examples for the `showitems` TCA section in content elements
============================================================

..  _types-content-examples-basic:

Basic custom content element with header and bodytext
-----------------------------------------------------

..  literalinclude:: _CodeSnippets/_basic_content_element.php
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php

The following tabs are shown, the header palette and bodytext field are shown
in palette general:

..  _types-content-examples-extended:

Extended content element with custom fields
-------------------------------------------

..  literalinclude:: _CodeSnippets/_extended_content_element.php
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php

The following tabs are shown:

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/tt_content_extended.png

Additional fields that are subsequently added to the end of the table using
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addToAllTcaTypes()`
will appear in the tab :guilabel:`Extended`.

..  _types-content-migration:

Migration: Remove system fields from showitems on dropping TYPO3 v12.4 support
==============================================================================

It is sufficient to apply changes to the :confval:`types-showitem` section
of content types once dropping TYPO3 v12.4 support in extensions.

In site packages or extensions only supporting TYPO3 v13.3 or above you can
migrate the :confval:`types-showitem` right away:

..  literalinclude:: _CodeSnippets/tt_content_migration.diff
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php (diff)

So the tabs :guilabel:`General`, :guilabel:`Language`, :guilabel:`Access`
and :guilabel:`Notes` are now added automatically together with the
corresponding system fields.
