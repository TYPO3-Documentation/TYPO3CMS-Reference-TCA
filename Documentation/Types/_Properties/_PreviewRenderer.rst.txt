        Registration of subtypes has been deprecated.  Registration of custom
        types should therefore always be done by using
        :confval:`record types <ctrl-type>`.

        See also :ref:`migration-subtype-previewrenderer`.

    To configure a preview renderer for the whole table see
    :confval:`ctrl-previewRenderer`.

    Configures a backend preview for a content element.

    Have also a look at :ref:`t3coreapi:ConfigureCE-Preview` for more details.

    Use :confval:`property previewRenderer of section ctrl <ctrl-previewRenderer>`
    to configure the preview globally for the whole table.
