    ..  warning:: This will be removed in TYPO3 without replacement.

        In case, extensions still use this setting, they should switch to casual
        :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA']['someTable']['ctrl']['type']` fields instead, which
        can be powered by columns based on string values.

    Field name, which holds a value being the integer (bit-mask) for the 'bitmask\_excludelist\_bits' array.

    It works much like 'subtype\_value\_field' but excludes fields based on whether a bit from the value field is set.
    See property :ref:`bitmask\_excludelist\_bits <types-properties-bitmask-excludelist-bits>`.

    These two properties are rarely used, but pretty powerful if a 'type=radio' or 'type=check' field
    is set as bitmask\_value\_field.

    [+/-] indicates whether the bit [bit-number] is set or not.
