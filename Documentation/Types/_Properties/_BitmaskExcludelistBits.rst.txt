    :type: array


    ..  warning:: This will be removed in TYPO3 without replacement.

        In case, extensions still use this setting, they should switch to casual
        :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA']['someTable']['ctrl']['type']` fields instead, which
        can be powered by columns based on string values.

    See :ref:`bitmask\_value\_field <types-properties-bitmask-value-field>`.

    Syntax:
      "[+/-][bit-number]" => "[comma-separated list of fields (from the main types-config) excluded]"
