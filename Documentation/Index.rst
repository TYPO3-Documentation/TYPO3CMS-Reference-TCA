**Core Manual**

This document is a Core Manual. Core Manuals address the built in

options, etc.

Core Manuals are written as reference manuals. The reader should rely
on the Table of Contents to identify what particular section will best
address the task at hand.


**Versions**

TCA properties change between major versions, this main array had significant refactorings
especially between core versions 6.2 to 7 LTS, and again between 7 LTS and 8 LTS. Use the version
selector of this documentation to select the documentation variant that fits.
