**Official documentation**

This document is included as part of the official TYPO3 documentation.

**Core Manual**

This document is a Core Manual. Core Manuals address the built in
functionality of TYPO3 and are designed to provide the reader with in-
depth information. Each Core Manual addresses a particular process or
function and how it is implemented within the TYPO3 source code. These
may include information on available APIs, specific configuration
options, etc.

Core Manuals are written as reference manuals. The reader should rely
on the :ref:`sitemap` to identify what particular section will best
address the task at hand.


**Versions**

TCA properties change between major versions, this main array had significant refactorings
especially between core versions 6.2 to 7 LTS, and again between 7 LTS and 8 LTS. Use the version
selector of this documentation to select the documentation variant that fits.
