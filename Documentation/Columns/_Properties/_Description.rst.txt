    :name: columns-description
    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$field]
    :Required: false
    :type: string or LLL reference
    :Scope: Display
    :Example: :ref:`columns-example-basic`

    The property can be used to display an additional help text between the field label and
    the user input when editing records. As an example, the Core uses the description property
    in the site configuration module when editing a site on some properties like `identifier`.

    The property is available on all common `TCA` types like `input` and `select` and so on.

    The field can be used with a string that will be directly output or with a
    language reference.
