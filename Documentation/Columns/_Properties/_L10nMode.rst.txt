    :Required: false
    :type: string (keyword)
    :Scope: Display / Proc.
    :Example: :ref:`tca_example_translated_text_2`, :ref:`tca_example_l10n_mode`

    Only active if the :ref:`['ctrl']['languageField'] <ctrl-reference-languagefield>` property is set.

    The main relevance is when a record is localized by an API call in DataHandler that makes a copy of the default
    language record. You can think of this process as copying all fields from the source record. By default, the given
    value from the default language record is copied to the localization overlay and the field is editable in the
    overlay record. This behaviour can be changed:

    exclude
        Field will not be shown in FormEngine if this record is a localization of the default language. Works basically
        like a display condition. Internally, the field value of the default language record is copied over to the
        field of the localized record. The DataHandler keeps the values of localized records in sync and actively copies
        a changed value from the default language record into the localized overlays if changed.
        You can force the field to be displayed as readonly (with default language value)
        by setting  :ref:`"l10n_display" <columns-properties-l10n-display>` to `defaultAsReadonly`.

    prefixLangTitle
        The field value from the default language record gets copied when a localization overlay is created, but the
        content is prefixed with the title of the target language. The field stays editable in the localized record.
        It only works for field types like "text" and "input". The text will be prepended and can be configured by
        the page TSconfig property :ref:`TCEMAIN.translateToMessage <t3tsconfig:pagetcemain-translatetomessage>`

    If this property is not set for a given field, the value of the default language record is copied over to the
    localized record on creation, the field value is then distinct from the default language record, can be edited
    at will and will never be overwritten by the DataHandler if the value of the default language record changes.
