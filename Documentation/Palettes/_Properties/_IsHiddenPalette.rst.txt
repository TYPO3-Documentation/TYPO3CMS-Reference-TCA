    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['palettes']
    :type: boolean

    If set to true, this palette will never be shown, but the fields of the palette are technically
    rendered as hidden elements in FormEngine.

    This is sometimes useful when you want to set a field's value by JavaScript from another user-defined field.
    You can also use it along with the IRRE (TCA columns type :ref:`inline <columns-inline>`)
    :ref:`foreign_selector <columns-inline-properties-foreign-selector>` feature if you don't want the relation
    field to be displayed (it must be technically present and rendered though, that's why you should put it to
    a hidden palette in that case).

    ..  note::
        The "isHiddenPalette" concept is more a hack than a solution in current FormEngine code. It has been
        introduced for the "FAL" file resource handling to have virtual fields which can be handled in JavaScript
        but are not displayed to the editor. It comes with the price of a bunch of HTML that is disabled
        via CSS if editing those records in the backend. The core will sooner or later reconsider this solution
        and substitute it with something more appropriate. Extension authors should stay away from this property
        if possible to not run into upgrade troubles if that happens.
