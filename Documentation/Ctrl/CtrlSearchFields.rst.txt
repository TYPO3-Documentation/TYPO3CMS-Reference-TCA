searchFields
------------

:aspect:`Datatype`
    string

:aspect:`Scope`
    Search

:aspect:`Description`
    Comma-separated list of fields from the table that will be included when searching for records in the TYPO3 backend.
    No record from a table will ever be found if that table does not have "searchFields" defined.

    There are more fine grained controls per column, see the documentation of the "search" key of any type in :ref:`columns-types`.

    **Example from "tt\_content" table:**

    .. code-block:: php

        'ctrl' => [
            'searchFields' => 'header,header_link,subheader,bodytext,pi_flexform',
            ...
        ],
