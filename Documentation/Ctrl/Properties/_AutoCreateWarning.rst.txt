..  warning::
    Columns created automatically by being defined by this property
    still need to be added manually to the palettes and types definition.

    Due to the :ref:`TCA loading order <ctrl-auto-created-columns-loading-order>`
    these columns are only created if the according ctrl property was added in
    the original definition in :file:`Configuration/TCA/<tablename>.php`, not
    if they were defined in the overrides like
    :file:`Configuration/TCA/Overrides/something.php`.
