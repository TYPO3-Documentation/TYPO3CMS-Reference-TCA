    :name: ctrl-languageField
    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['ctrl']
    :type: string (field name of type :ref:`language <columns-language>`)
    :Scope: Proc. / Display

    .. deprecated:: 11.2
      This field can only be used with the type
      :ref:`language <columns-language>`. All other field types will be
      automatically migrated on-the-fly possibly losing configurations.
      See :ref:`Migration to the language type <columns-languge-migration>`

    This property contains the field name of the field which contains a pointer to the
    language of the record. The field should have the type
    :ref:`language <columns-language>`. The field is called
    :ref:`sys_language_uid <field-sys_language_uid>` by convention.

    This TCA type automatically displays all available languages for the
    current context (the corresponding site configuration) and also automatically
    adds the special `-1` language (meaning `all languages`) for all record
    types, except `pages`.

    Backend users can be limited to have edit access for only certain of
    these languages and if this option is set, edit access for languages
    will be enforced for this table.

    Also see the :ref:`Frontend Localization Guide <t3translate:core-support-tca>`
    for a discussion about the effects of
    this property (and other TCA properties) on the localization process.
