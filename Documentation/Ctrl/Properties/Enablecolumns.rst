    Specifies which *publishing control features* are automatically implemented for the table.

    This includes that records can be "disabled" or "hidden", have a starting and/or ending time and be access
    controlled so only a certain front end user group can access them. This property is used by the
    :ref:`RestrictionBuilder <t3coreapi:database-restriction-builder>` to create SQL fragments.

    These are the keys in the array you can use. Each of the values must be a field name in the table which
    should be used for the feature:

    disabled
        Defines which field serves as hidden/disabled flag.

    starttime
        Defines which field contains the starting time.

    endtime
        Defines which field contains the ending time.

    fe\_group
        Defines which field is used for access control via a selection of FE user groups.

    .. note::
        In general these fields do *not* affect the access or display in the backend! They are primarily
        related to the frontend. However the icon of records having these features enabled will
        normally change as these examples show:

    See also the :ref:`delete <ctrl-reference-delete>` feature which is related, but is active for both frontend and backend.

Enablecolumns / enablefields usage
==================================

Most ways of retrieving records in the frontend automatically respect the
:php:`ctrl->enablecolumns` settings:

Enablecolumns in TypoScript
---------------------------

Records retrieved in TypoScript via the objects
:ref:`RECORDS <t3tsref:cobj-records>`, :ref:`CONTENT <t3tsref:cobj-content>`
automatically respect the settings in section
:ref:`ctrl->enablecolumns <ctrl-reference-enablecolumns>`.

Enablecolumns / enablefields in Extbase
----------------------------------------

In Extbase repositories the records are hidden in the frontend by default,
however this behaviour can be disabled by setting
:php:`$querySettings->setIgnoreEnableFields(true)` in the
:ref:`repository <t3coreapi:extbase-repository>`.

Enablecolumns in queries
-------------------------

Using the QueryBuilder
:ref:`enable columns restrictions are automatically applied <t3coreapi:database-select>`.

The same is true when
:ref:`select() is called on the connection <t3coreapi:database-connection-select>`.

See the :ref:`t3coreapi:database-restriction-builder` for details.
