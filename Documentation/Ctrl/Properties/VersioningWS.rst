   :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['ctrl']
   :type: boolean
   :Scope: Proc.


   If set, versioning is enabled for this table.

   .. note::
      The field details explained here are outdated.

   Versioning in TYPO3 is based on this scheme:

   .. code-block:: none

      [Online version, pid>=0] 1- * [Offline versions, pid==1]

   Offline versions are identified by having a pid value = -1 and they
   refer to their online version by the field "t3ver\_oid". Offline
   versions of the "Page" and "Branch" types (contrary to "Element" type)
   can have child records which points to the uid of their offline "root"
   version with their pid fields (as usual). These children records are
   typically copies of child elements of the online version of the
   offline root version, but are not considered "versions" of them in a
   technical sense, hence they don't point to them with their t3ver\_oid
   field (and shouldn't).

   In the backend "Offline" is labeled "Draft" while "Online" is labeled "Live".

   In order for versioning to work on a table there are certain requirements; Tables supporting versioning
   must have these fields:

   t3ver\_oid
     For offline versions; pointing back to online
     version uid. For online: 0 (zero)

   t3ver\_id
     Incremental integer (version number)

   t3ver\_wsid
     For offline versions: Workspace ID of version.
     For all workspace Ids apart from 0 (zero) there can be only one
     version of an element per ID. For online: 0 (zero) unless t3ver\_state
     is set in which case it plays a role for previews in the backend (to
     no de-select placeholders for workspaces, see
     :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Utility\BackendUtility::versioningPlaceholderClause())`
     and for publishing of move-to-actions (see
     :code:`\TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Utility\BackendUtility::getMovePlaceholder()`).

   t3ver\_state
      Contains special states of a version used when new, deleted, moved content requires versioning.

      -  For an  **online** version:

         -  "1" or "2" means that it is a temporary placeholder for a new element (which is the offline version of this record)
         -  "3" means it is a "move-to-location" placeholder and t3ver\_move\_id
            holds uid of online record (with an offline version) to move . Unlike
            for "1" and "2" there is  *no offline version* of this record type!
            (V2 feature)
         -  If "t3ver\_state" has a value >0 it should never be shown in Live workspace.

      -  For an  **offline** version:

         -  "1" or "2" means that when published, the element must be deleted (placeholder for delete-action).
         -  "-1" means it is just an indication that the online version has the flag set to "1" (is a placeholder for
            new records.). This only affects display, not processing anywhere.
         -  "4" means this version is a "move-pointer" for the online record and an online "move-to-location"
            (t3ver\_state=3) record exists. (V2 feature)


   t3ver\_stage
      Contains the ID of the stage at which the record is. Special values are "0" which still refers to
      "edit", "-10" refers to "ready to publish".

   t3ver\_count
      0/offline=draft/never published, 0/online=current, 1/offline=archive, 1+=multiple online/offline
      occurrences (incrementation happens when versions are swapped offline.)

   t3ver\_tstamp
      Timestamp of last swap/publish action.

   t3ver\_move\_id
      For online records with t3ver\_state=3 this indicates the online record to move to this location upon publishing
      of the offline version of the online record "t3ver\_move\_id" points to.

   The fields **pid** and **uid** should have "signed" attributes in MySQL (so their content can be negative!)

   **Corresponding SQL definitions:**

   .. code-block:: mysql

      t3ver_oid int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
      t3ver_id int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
      t3ver_wsid int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
      t3ver_state tinyint(4) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
      t3ver_stage int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,

   **Special "t3ver\_swapmode" field for pages**

   When pages are versioned it is an option whether content and even the branch of the page is versioned. This is
   determined by the parameter "treeLevels" set when the page is versioned. "-1" means swap only record, 0 means
   record and content and >0 means full branch. When the version is later published the swapping will happen accordingly.
