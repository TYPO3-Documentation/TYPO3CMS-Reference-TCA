=================================

:aspect:`Datatype`
    boolean

:aspect:`Scope`
    Special

:aspect:`Description`
    If set, this table can always be edited live even in a workspace and
    even if "live editing" is not enabled in a custom workspace. For
    instance this is set by default for Backend user and group records
    since it is assumed that administrators like the flexibility of
    editing backend users without having to go to the Live workspace.
