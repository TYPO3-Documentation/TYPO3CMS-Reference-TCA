=======================
Table properties (ctrl)
=======================

The ['ctrl'] section contains properties for a database table in general.

These properties are basically divided into two main categories:

-  Properties which affect how a table is *displayed* and handled in
   the backend *interface*. This includes which icon is shown and which name is given for a record. It defines which
   column contains the title value, which column contains the type value etc.

-  Properties which determine how entries in the backend interface are processed by the system
   (TCE). This includes the publishing control, the "deleted" flag, whether a table
   can only be edited by admin-users, whether a table may only exist in the tree root etc.
