=======================
Table properties (ctrl)
=======================

The `ctrl` section contains properties for a database table in general.

These properties are basically divided into two main categories:

-   Properties which affect how a table is *displayed* and handled in
    the backend. This includes which icon is shown and which name is given for a record. It defines which
    column contains the title value, which column contains the type value etc.

-   Properties which determine how entries in the backend interface are processed by the system
    (TCE). This includes the publishing control, the "deleted" flag, whether a table
    can only be edited by admin-users, whether a table may only exist in the tree root etc.
