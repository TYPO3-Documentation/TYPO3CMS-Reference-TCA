    This option can be used to group records in the new record wizard. If you define a new table and set
    its "groupName" to the key of another extension, the table will appear in the list of records from that
    other extension in the new record wizard.

    We really appreciate you setting the `ctrl` property `title` to a localized value (`LLL:EXT:`), otherwise 
    it may happen that TYPO3 cannot extract the correct extension key from your table name, resulting in  
    wrong icons in list of new record wizard. This only happens if your extension key contains
    underscores `_`, but the second part of your table name does not. For example: If your extension key 
    is `my_extension` the table names will normally start with `tx_myextension`. Since `myextension` does not
    match the real extension key `my_extension`, the icon of your extension cannot be retrieved from your 
    extension. Instead of a localized `title`, you can also set `groupName` to your real extension
    key: `my_extension`.
