    This marks a table to be "static".

    A "static table" means that it should not be updated for individual
    databases because it is meant to be centrally updated and distributed.
    For instance static tables could contain country-codes used in many
    systems.

    The foremost property of a static table is that the uid's used are the
    SAME across systems. Import/Export of records expect static records to
    be common for two systems.
