        Modern TYPO3 projects rarely rely on static data tables, and better
        mechanisms now exist for managing read-only or reference data. One can
        use TCA options like `readOnly`, `editlock` or backend access control
        to limit editing if needed.

    This marks a table to be "static".

    A "static table" means that it should not be updated for individual
    databases because it is meant to be centrally updated and distributed.
    For instance static tables could contain country-codes used in many
    systems.

    The foremost property of a static table is that the uid's used are the
    SAME across systems. Import/Export of records expect static records to
    be common for two systems.
