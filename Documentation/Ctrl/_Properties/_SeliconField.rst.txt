   Field name, which contains the thumbnail image used to represent the record visually whenever it is shown
   in FormEngine as a foreign reference selectable from a selector box.

   This field must be a :ref:`columns-file` field where icon files are selected. Since only the
   first icon file will be used, the :ref:`columns-inline-properties-maxitems` option should be used to allow only
   selecting a single icon file.

   You should consider this a feature where you can attach an "icon" to a record which is typically selected as a
   reference in other records, for example a "category". In such a case this field points out the icon image which
   will then be shown. This feature can thus enrich the visual experience of selecting the relation in other forms.

The table :sql:`tx_styleguide_elements_select_single_12_foreign` is defined as
follows:


.. include:: /CodeSnippets/Manual/SelectSingle12ForeignPart.rst.txt


It can be used in another table as a foreign relation, for example in a field
with render type :php:`singleSelect`:

.. include:: /CodeSnippets/SelectSingle12.rst.txt


You can find this example in the :ref:`extension styleguide <styleguide>`.
