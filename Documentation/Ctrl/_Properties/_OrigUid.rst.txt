..  confval:: origUid
    :name: ctrl-origUid
    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['ctrl']
    :type: string (field name)
    :Scope: Proc.

    Field name, which will contain the UID of the original record in case a
    record is created as a copy or new version of another record.

    Is used when new versions are created from elements and enables the backend
    to display a visual comparison between a new version and its original.

    By convention the name :ref:`t3_origuid <field_t3_origuid>`
    is used for that field.

    ..  note::
        The database field configured in this property is created automatically.
        It does not have to be added to the :file:`ext_tables.sql`.

    ..  rubric:: Example

    The following fields are set by the DataHandler automatically on creating or
    updating records, if they are configured in the :php:`ctrl` section of the TCA:

    ..  literalinclude:: _CodeSnippets/_DataHandlerFields.php
        :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/TCA/tx_myextension_domain_model_something.php
