..  confval:: searchFields
    :name: ctrl-searchFields
    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['ctrl']
    :type: string
    :Scope: Search


    Comma-separated list of fields from the table that will be included when searching for records in the TYPO3 backend.
    No record from a table will ever be found if that table does not have `searchFields` defined. Only fields of the
    following TCA types are searchable:

    *   :ref:`input <columns-input>`
    *   :ref:`text <columns-text>`
    *   :ref:`flex <columns-flex>`
    *   :ref:`email <columns-email>`
    *   :ref:`link <columns-link>`
    *   :ref:`slug <columns-slug>`
    *   :ref:`color <columns-color>`
    *   :ref:`json <columns-json>`
    *   :ref:`uuid <columns-uuid>`

    Adding fields of different types to `searchFields` has no effect.

    There are more fine grained controls per column, see the documentation of the "search" key of any
    type in :ref:`columns-types`.

    ..  note::

        Fields of type :ref:`number <columns-number>` or :ref:`datetime <columns-datetime>`
        may be excluded from search by default. To include them, modify the search query with this hook:
        :doc:`ext_core:Changelog/9.2/Feature-71911-AddConstraintHookInDatabaseRecordListMakeSearchString`.


    ..  note::

        When searching as admin the fields `uid` and `pid` are automatically included.
        For editors, `uid` and/or `pid` have to be added manually to the searchFields list.
