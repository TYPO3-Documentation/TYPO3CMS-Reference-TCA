        TYPO3 now automatically includes all fields of suitable types in
        backend search operations, e.g., in the List module.

        Therefore this option has been removed.

        Fields can be removed from the search by setting
        `searchable  <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tca:confval-input-searchable>`_
        to `false`.

        If :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['ctrl']['searchFields']` is set an
        automatic TCA migration sets all suitable fields, which are not included
        in the :php:`searchFields` configuration, to :php:`searchable => false` to
        keep current behavior.

        ..  rubric:: Migration

        If your extension previously relied on the :php:`searchFields` TCA option,
        remove it from the :php:`ctrl` section and instead define :php:`'searchable' => false`
        on fields that should be excluded from search results.

        No action is needed if the default behavior (search all suitable fields)
        is acceptable.
