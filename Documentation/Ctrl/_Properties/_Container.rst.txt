..  confval:: container
    :name: ctrl-container
    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['ctrl']
    :type: array
    :Scope: Display
    :Examples: :ref:`tca_example_ctrl_container`

    Array to configure additional items in render containers of :ref:`FormEngine <t3coreapi:FormEngine>`,
    see section :ref:`Node expansion <t3coreapi:FormEngine-Rendering-NodeExpansion>`.

    Next to single elements, some render container allow to be "enriched" with additional information via
    the "node expansion" API. Currently, the :php:`OuterWrapContainer` implements :php:`fieldWizard` and
    :php:`fieldInformation`. :php:`InlineControlContainer` implements :php:`fieldWizard` and comes with
    the default wizard :php:`localizationStateSelector`. Custom containers may implement expansion nodes, too,
    and if implemented correctly will automatically have their configuration merged with the definition
    provided in this TCA array.

    The basic array looks like::

        'ctrl' => [
            'container' => [
                '<containerRenderType>' => [
                    'fieldWizard' => [
                        '<aName>' => [
                            'renderType' => '<aRenderType>',
                            'before' => ['<anotherName>'],
                            'after' => ['<yetAnotherName>'],
                            'disabled' => false,
                            'options' => [],
                        ],
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],

    <containerRenderType>
        should be a defined container render type.
        You can find more about the :code:`outerWrapContainer` and
        :code:`inlineControlContainer` in the FormEngine documentation section on
        :ref:`rendering <t3coreapi:FormEngine-Rendering>`.
        Valid types are for example:

        -   :code:`outerWrapContainer` type which corresponds to the
            :php:`OuterWrapContainer` (class).
        -   :code:`inlineControlContainer` type which corresponds to the
            :php:`InlineControlContainer` class
        -   :code:`inline` type which corresponds to the :php:`InlineControlContainer`
            class.

    renderType
        refers to a registered node name from :php:`NodeFactory`

    before, after
        can be set to sort single wizards relative to each other.

    disabled
        can be used to disable built in default wizards.

    options
        Some wizards may support additional "options".

    Note, next to "fieldWizard", some containers may also implement "fieldInformation", which can be
    manipulated the same way.
