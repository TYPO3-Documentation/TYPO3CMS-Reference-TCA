    :name: ctrl-transOrigPointerField
    :Path: $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['ctrl']
    :type: string (field name)
    :Scope: Proc. / Display


    Name of the field, by convention :ref:`l10n_parent <field-l10n_parent>`, used by
    translations to point back to the original record, the record in the default
    language of which they are a translation.

    If this value is found being set together with :ref:`languageField <ctrl-reference-languagefield>` then
    FormEngine will show the default translation value under the fields in the main form. This is very neat
    if translators are to see what they are translating.

    The target field must be configured in :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA'][<table>]['columns']`,
    at least as a passthrough type.

    .. note::
        Sometimes :sql:`l18n_parent` is used for this field in Core tables. This
        is for historic reasons.
